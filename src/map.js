            Assassin's Creed is an action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft
            Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the first installment in
            the Assassin's Creed series. The video game was released for
            PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in November 2007. A Microsoft Windows
            version titled Assassin's Creed: Director's Cut Edition containing
            additional content was released in April 2008. The plot is set in a
            fictional history of real-world events, taking place primarily
            during the Third Crusade in the Holy Land in 1191. The player
            character is a modern-day man named Desmond Miles who, through a
            machine called the Animus, relives the genetic memories of his
            ancestor, Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad. Through this plot device, details
            emerge about a millennia-old struggle between two factions: the
            Assassin Brotherhood (inspired by the real-life Order of Assassins),
            who fight to preserve peace and free will, and the Templar Order
            (inspired by the Knights Templar military order), who seek to
            establish peace through order and control. Both factions fight over
            powerful artifacts of mysterious origins known as Pieces of Eden to
            gain an advantage over each other. The 12th-century portion of the
            story follows Altaïr, an Assassin, who embarks on a quest to regain
            his honour after botching a mission to recover one such artifact
            from the Templars; he does so by finding and assassinating nine
            targets across the Holy Land. The gameplay focuses on using Altaïr's
            combat, stealth, and parkour abilities to defeat enemies and explore
            the environment. The game features counter-based hack-and-slash
            combat, social stealth (the ability to use crowds of people and the
            environment to hide from enemies), and a large open world comprising
            various regions of the Holy Land, primarily the cities of Masyaf,
            Jerusalem, Acre, and Damascus, all of which have been accurately
            recreated to fit the game's period. While most of the game takes
            place within a simulation based on Altaïr's memories, the player
            will occasionally be forced out of the Animus to play as Desmond in
            the modern day. Here, they are restricted to exploring a small
            laboratory facility, as Desmond has been kidnapped by a shady
            corporation looking for specific information within Altaïr's
            memories that will further their enigmatic goals. Upon release,
            Assassin's Creed received generally positive reviews, with critics
            praising its storytelling, visuals, art design, and originality,
            while criticism mostly focused on the repetitive nature of its
            gameplay. Assassin's Creed won several awards at the 2006 E3 and
            several end-year awards after its release. The game spawned two
            spin-offs: Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles (2008) and
            Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines (2009), which exclude the modern-day
            aspect and focus entirely on Altaïr. A direct sequel, Assassin's
            Creed II, was released in November 2009. The sequel continues the
            modern-day narrative following Desmond but introduces a new
            storyline set during the Italian Renaissance in the late 15th
            century and a new protagonist, Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Since the
            release and success of Assassin's Creed II, subsequent games have
            been released with various other Assassins and periods
